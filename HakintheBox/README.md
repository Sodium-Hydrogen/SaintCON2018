#### First off ####
An ATtiny85 is not meant to do what I have it doing so there are glitches and the WS2812b's 
will occationally crash or not even work sometimes. So use the libraries at the version I used 
to make sure everthing works.<br>
* ```TinyWireS``` is attached
* ```ADCTouch``` 1.0.3
* ```Adafruit Neopixel``` 1.1.6
